# My methode for easy laser design creations, LaserCutter2D

I have been using laserCut by [bmsleight](https://github.com/bmsleight/lasercut), for a while. 
As I do not need the 3D stuff for my purpose, I did remove 3D stuff, like cube([x,y,z]) => square([x,y]). 
Now I can directly export dxf files right out of OpenSCAD. 
And in addition, I now can engrave/raster in such a way that I can visually see the result right away, while working in OpenSCAD. The output is then exported to SVG (or pdf).
